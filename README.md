# Tower-Defense-Tutorial-Series

This is the repository for the Godot 4.x Tower Defense Tutorial Series. 

This repository contains all assets used in the tutorial. The assets are supposed to be downloaded and added to a newly created Godot projects as shown in the Part 0 of the tutorial series. 

This repository does not contain code, scenes, scripts or otherwise files created during the tutorial. The tutorial series is a beginner series and you won't learn much by just copy pasting. Write the code, go through the motions :)
